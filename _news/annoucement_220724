I've been awarded the Margaret and Martin Gotheridge Award 🏆 by the British Federation of Women Graduate for my PhD research!
BFWG academic awards are awarded to female doctoral students for “outstanding academic achievements and ability to communicate complex research to a non-specialist audience”.
