### About me

I'm a 3rd year Computing PhD student in the [BiomedIA lab](https://biomedia.doc.ic.ac.uk/) at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/), supervised by [Prof. Ben Glocker](http://wp.doc.ic.ac.uk/bglocker/) and fully funded by an [Imperial College President's scholarship](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/fees-and-funding/postgraduate-doctoral/grants-scholarships/presidents-phd/). My research interests cover various aspects of medical imaging machine learning, in particular reliability and safety of these systems. <br/>

##### Background 
I started my studies with a B.Sc. in Mathematics as well as a postgraduate diploma in Statistics from the University of Strasbourg (France). Later, I graduated with distinction from [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html) with a M.Sc. in Data Science, focusing on medical applications of machine learning. I then joined [Microsoft Research Cambridge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-cambridge/) (UK), where I was an Applied Researcher in the [InnerEye team](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/medical-image-analysis/), focusing on developing ML models for personalized treatment as well as on open-source efforts in ML for healthcare. In October 2021, I then started my PhD at [Imperial](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/). I joined the [Kheiron Medical Technologies](https://www.kheironmed.com/) ML research team for an internship from April to October 2022.
